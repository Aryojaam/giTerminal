navigate to your downloads folder and clone giTerminal
`cd ~/Downloads/ && git clone https://github.com/Aryojaam/giTerminal.git`

then run the installer by
`cd giTerminal && ./installer`

you can now use giTerminal by running `giTerminal` in your terminal :)

when there are updates you can just simply run `giTerminalUpdater` and it should update the program :) Enjoy!
